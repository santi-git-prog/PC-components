        <h1>Computer Components</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Motherboard</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The motherboard is the primary circuit board that connects all the essential components of the computer. It serves as a communication hub for the CPU, RAM, storage devices, GPU, and other peripherals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chipsets:</strong> Determines the functionality and compatibility of various components.</li>
            <li><strong>Bus Systems:</strong> The motherboard features various buses (PCIe, SATA, etc.) for data transfer between components.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Processor (CPU)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer. It executes instructions from programs and processes data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clock Speed:</strong> Measured in GHz, it determines how fast the CPU can process instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> Small, high-speed storage within the CPU that stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> RAM is temporary memory that stores data actively used or processed by the CPU. It allows for faster data retrieval compared to storage devices like HDDs or SSDs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volatile Memory:</strong> RAM loses its contents when the computer is turned off, unlike storage devices that retain data.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> RAM speed (measured in MHz) affects how quickly data can be accessed and transferred.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Storage Devices (HDD/SSD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Storage devices are used to save and retrieve data on a long-term basis.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> Older and slower technology using spinning magnetic platters. It's generally cheaper and provides larger capacities.</li>
            <li><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD):</strong> Faster and more durable, as it uses flash memory to store data. SSDs are more expensive but significantly improve boot times and data access speeds.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The PSU converts alternating current (AC) power from the wall into direct current (DC) power, which is used by the computer's internal components.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Power supplies have efficiency ratings (e.g., 80 Plus) that indicate how efficiently they convert AC to DC power, with higher efficiency resulting in less wasted power and heat.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations. It's especially important for gaming, video editing, and other graphics-intensive tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dedicated vs Integrated GPU:</strong> A dedicated GPU has its own memory and processing power, while integrated GPUs are built into the CPU or motherboard.</li>
            <li><strong>VRAM (Video RAM):</strong> VRAM is the memory used by the GPU to store textures and images. Higher VRAM is important for tasks like 4K gaming or professional graphics work.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Cooling System</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Cooling systems prevent components like the CPU and GPU from overheating, which could lead to thermal throttling or hardware damage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Cooling:</strong> Uses fans and heat sinks to dissipate heat. Itâ€™s the most common and cost-effective method.</li>
            <li><strong>Case Airflow:</strong> Ensuring proper airflow within the case is essential for optimal cooling, involving strategic placement of fans for intake and exhaust.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Input/Output Ports</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> These ports allow users to connect external devices like keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, and network cables to the computer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>USB Ports:</strong> Commonly used for peripherals like mice, keyboards, and external drives. They come in various types (USB-A, USB-C) with varying speeds.</li>
            <li><strong>HDMI/DisplayPort:</strong> Used for connecting monitors, providing video and audio output.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethernet:</strong> Wired connection for network access, offering stable and fast internet connectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Jacks:</strong> For connecting headphones, speakers, or microphones.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Optical Drives</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Optical drives are used for reading and writing data to CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs. They are becoming less common in modern systems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Read/Write Capabilities:</strong> Some optical drives can only read discs, while others can also write or burn data to optical media.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Blu-ray drives can hold more data than regular DVDs, with up to 50 GB on dual-layer Blu-ray discs.</li>
        </ul>
